# Breast-Cancer-Image-Classification
Build a CNN classifier to identify breast cancer from images

In this script we have build three iterations of model.

1) Base CNN model with Batch Normalization and no residual connections: CNN_network.ipynb
2) CNN using Data Augmentation: Using_Data_Augmentation.ipynb
3) The third model creates a CNN model with residual connections: ResNet.ipynb

Our objective was to try different techniques on CNN base model and analyze the results.
