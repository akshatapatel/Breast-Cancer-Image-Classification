# Breast-Cancer-Image-Classification
Build a CNN classifier to identify breast cancer from images

In this script we have build three iterations of model.

1) Base CNN model with Batch normalization and no residual connections
2) Enhanced the base model using augmented data by applying different transformations on images
3) The third model creates a CNN model with residual connections.

Our objective was to try different techniques on CNN base model and analyze the results.
